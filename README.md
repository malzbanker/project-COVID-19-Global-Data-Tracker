📊 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
📌 Project Description

This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends including confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccination progress. Using real-world datasets from Our World in Data, it performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), creates visualizations, and summarizes insights into the global pandemic response.

By the end, the project delivers a well-documented Jupyter Notebook (or PDF report) with clear visuals and narrative explanations.

🚩 Project Objectives

✅ Import and clean global COVID-19 datasets

✅ Explore time trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations

✅ Compare metrics across selected countries/regions

✅ Create visualizations (line charts, bar charts, maps)

✅ Communicate insights through a structured notebook report

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x

pandas → data loading & cleaning

matplotlib → charts & plots

seaborn → advanced visualizations

plotly (optional) → interactive maps & charts

Jupyter Notebook (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)

💡 Insights & Reflections

Countries showed different pandemic trajectories due to population size, healthcare infrastructure, and policies.

Death rates varied significantly, highlighting differences in testing, reporting, and medical capacity.

Vaccination rollouts were faster in developed countries, but many developing regions showed gradual progress.

Data analysis revealed anomalies and spikes that aligned with known pandemic waves.
